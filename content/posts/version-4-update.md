The future of Infinity Bot List!

As we are sure most of you may have noticed by now the Infinity Bots [Discord Server](https://infinitybotlist.com/discord) is
nearing the one thousand member mark we first of all want to say thank you all for your love and support and helping us grow, 
but this now leaves us all asking. What's the next step for the Infinity Bot List Server and Website.
Over the past few months our Dev Team has been working on hard behind the scenes on the new and improved website and hope to
have a final release date for you all as soon as they possibly can.

While we are as excited as anybody else to see what the future has in store for our website and our services as a whole
they do still have the current website and code to worry about, update and maintain so please bare with us through this
long and painful process.

## v3 Major Changes
So now let's talk about what's to come for the current website in the meantime, We have rolled out multiple new ways
for you to interact with us/show us some love as well as better oppertunity's to get your bot listed on our home page.

The most important chanes to note are things that won't stand out on the Infinity Bots front end to someone who isn't
'keen' or have a decent knowledge base in web development so let's intsead talk about the things that you for sure will
notice.

Ad-Slots have been released in a beta stage for the time being while we work on ways to implement a proper payment and 
subscription management service, more detailed information about our Ad-Slots and Pricing can be foudn in our Discord Server

Along with the Ad-Slots most of you may have noticed that we now have a `Trending Bots` section on our home page
this is another one of our "recent" updates and one that we are actaully pretty excited about so let me break it down
for you. `Trending Bots` are added based on the amount of `Unique Views` they have as well as some other factors such
as: `Uptime Percentage, Invites etc`.

### But wait, Unique Views can be Faked!
Technically speaking in a average scenario yes they can, however our system is set up a little bit differently.
when a user logs into our website they are assigned a `Access Token` which is stored via their browsers built-in
cache, When said logged in user visits a bot page it takes that Users `Access Token` and `Discord ID` and checks
our Database to see if this is the first time the user has visited this bots page.

If the user is **not** `Logged In` and visits a Bots Page this is then counted as a `Average View` and will not count
towards the bots overall Statistics on our website or affect the amount of `Unique Views` the bot has at that time.

If you have any other questions or concerns regarding this matter, please feel free to reach out to us.

## Our new Status Page
On top of all the updates listed above, we have also released a new Status Page to show you the current status of our
website and all of our provided services (API etc) this status page is available to be viewed at [status.infinitybotlist.com](https://status.infinitybotlist.com)

Some things that you should definitely note about this status page are the fact that it is still being actively developed
and is **not** currently set up to privide real time information. our Dev Team is working hard to get our real time status
updates moved over to this status page as soon as possible but for now real time updates for the website can be found at [status.botlist.site](status.botlist.site)
