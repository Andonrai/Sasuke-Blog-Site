The wait is Finally Over!!

Over the past few months we have dedicated our time and energy into gathering user feedback regarding
what our users would like to see out of our version 4 update. And we have listened to almost all of your suggestions.

We plan to release Version 4 of Infinity Bot List by the beginning of August and yes for those of you who are wondering
we will be releasing our Server List shortly after the release of v4. So let's talk about the important stuff now.

## What to Expect!
For Version 4 we are planning to do a complete redesign on the site, and how it works and operates as well as some
changes to things that most users won't get a chance to see such as the Staff Panel and Admin Panel.

Following the release for Version 4 we will be making some well needed changes to our Discord Server,
most of which have already started such as a major Channel Cleanup and rework.

Our Dev Team may also see a delay in response times to our users as we dedicate our time to the
upcoming updates and maintenance of the website and all of our available services.

## Version 4
Version 4 of our website will include a huge variety of Front and Backend updates:

- Improved and Cleaner Staff Panel
- Improved Website and User Experience
- Imporved Forms for Adding, Editing Etc
- Improved Bot Packs and Pack Design
- Improved Widget Usage

And honestly the list goes on, I could go on for hours about what is and isnt being changed
but instead i think it's better to just leave you all in suspense üò≥ we are expecting to be
fully converted to our Bet Stages for V4 by the Beginning/Middle of August

## Server Listing
Our Server Listing website will be one of the Bigger Changes for Version 4 and will feature:

- Functuoning and Interactive API
- User Friendly Server Listing
- Bump System with Cooldowns and Reminders
- Certirication/Verification System

And honestly the list goes on, This is going to be one of our Bigger Updates to date
and comes with a variety of new features and services for you all to love and enjoy

I should say in advance at this time we **WILL NOT** be merging the Bot Listing and Server Listing
into one website but instead will run them both separately to help with load and performance in the long run.

Server Listing is expected to be fully implemented by the end of August - Mid September ‚ù§Ô∏è
